# Overview
In this project I tried to create a gallery page which shows images and on hovering over them it shows the image number and image becomes colorful from black and white.
This project uses the grid layout module to place images on the page. This projects is made to practice some useful and important CSS properties like filter property and it's values such as <i><b>greyscale</b></i> , <i><b>drop-shadow</b></i>, <i><b>blur</b></i> etc. and also the <i><b>CSS pseudo-classes</b></i>.

<i><b>This project is responsive</b></i> to different screen sizes.
